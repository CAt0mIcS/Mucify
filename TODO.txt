Bugs:
Playing audio --> Pausing --> Swiping notification away --> quickly opening e.g. Youtube and playing a random video --> Notification reapears

Notification can also appear randomly
Large numbers in settings cause crash



TODO:
ActivitySettings loads and edits very slowly
fragment_select_audio_layout doesn't have minimized player(does it need to?) and is a little outside of the toolbar
activity library: Bottom elements of history aren't displayed anymore
